\section{Typing decorated terms with MLL}

\begin{definition}
Define the typing system here, synchronization gives a cut rule, we use the reduction rules from before for cut elimination.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Cut elimination holds and terminates, for both $\to$ under $\equiv$ and $\leadsto$ under $\cong$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{myproof}
