%% Not-too boring ontroduction to the subject

\section*{Introduction}

This is an interesting introduction to an interesting subject.
\begin{itemize}
	\item state of the art?
	\item what we want: have terms wear the proof of a working reduction, which is proof they're well built.
	\item how we do it: introducing an annotated calculus, which annotations will allow us to easily type it by allowing interactions between two terms over one variable only. Defining the system well allows us to project to usual $\pi$-calculus, and maybe to compare with existing type systems for it.
	\item we would like the reduction to be confluent, the typing system to be without cut or with a cut elimination property (the latter holds), and the reduction with the typing system to preserve typing (it does).
\end{itemize}
