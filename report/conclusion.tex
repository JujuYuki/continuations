\section*{Conclusion}

A nice conclusion and working trails for later here. %TODO
\begin{itemize}
	\item what we did so far: working small part of the calculus, good properties and behavior, reasonable projection
	\item ideas for the behavior of $\equiv$ as a "bisimulation" in the annotated calculus
	\item behavior of $\leadsto$ and $\gtrsim$ with the projection: in the general case you do not want to have an action prefix be able to commute like that, but there is at least an "order" on the capabilities of terms u.P|Q and u.(P|Q)
	\item next step: work on exponential rules, and additive rules too
	\item talk about failed attempts here maybe, and/or about misleading intuitions that were explored in the past 2.5 months ?
	\item more things maybe, if something interesting comes up
\end{itemize}
